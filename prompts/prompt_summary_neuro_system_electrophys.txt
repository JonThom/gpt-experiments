Movement disorders in Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) are commonly associated with slow oscillations and increased synchrony of neuronal activity in the basal ganglia. 
The neural mechanisms underlying this dynamic network dysfunction, however, are only poorly understood. 
Here, we show that the strength of inhibitory inputs from striatum to globus pallidus external (GPe) is a key parameter controlling oscillations in the basal ganglia. 
Specifically, the increase in striatal activity observed in PD is sufficient to unleash the oscillations in the basal ganglia.
